In the given repo, I have added the solution for Theme 1 which was Smart Governance and Civic Engagement.In this solution,I have made a website that shows some important government resources or services.I heve also added a feature that if someone is not able to find his/her desirable resource, he/she can search in the search bar which works on the Custom Search API.I used API from Google Cloud Platform for the API Key.This website helps people to easily access all governmental sites, services easily at a single location.
The Simple Resource Directory provides a centralized platform where citizens can:
 1. Search for essential resources by name or category.
 2. Access contact details, addresses, and descriptions of public services.
 3. Filter resources based on categories like emergency services, healthcare, education, etc
